  What's your favorite screensaver?  Do you have a hard time picking just one?
If so, you're not alone!  With the literally thousands of screensavers that can
be downloaded right now, most of us have several screensavers that we enjoy
watching.  Whether it's gently flowing waterfalls, morphing geometrics, or
blasting enemy spaceships in the outer reaches of space, it can be hard to pick
just one favorite.  And any user of Windows knows that it can be a real hassle
to change your screensaver on a frequent basis.

  And that's exactly why you need ProSaver Screensaver Manager, from WaveBreak
Software!  ProSaver is a full-featured screensaver management and enhancement
application.  ProSaver will make your life easier and more fun in many ways:

 • Run all of your favorite screensavers without ever having to bother with the
   tedious Windows Control Panel.

 • Quickly and easily create playlists from your available screensavers and set
   them to play back just the way you like using our concise 'Options' sheet.

 • Newly downloaded screensavers can be added to the current playlist with a
   few clicks of the mouse, and "stale" screensavers deleted just as easily.

 • Organize your screensavers by theme, and give them ratings (from 1 to 5
   stars) so you can find the best ones quickly.

 • Open the ProSaver playlist window or start your screensaver instantly with
   the touch of a button.

  And, as an added feature, have you ever thought that a certain screensaver
would be just perfect ... if only it had a certain song playing in the back-
ground?  With ProSaver Screensaver Manager, you can do exactly that!  Add your
favorite music to almost any screensaver, either from your own collection or
from the sample audio that is included with ProSaver Screensaver Manager.

  Numerous audio formats are supported, including MP3, WAV, MIDI, WMA, AU, and
others.  You can play just one song with a particular screensaver, or you can
create entire playlists of music to go perfectly with all of your favorites.
You are the one running the show!

  ProSaver Screensaver Manager has been designed to be an easy-to-use and
professional application.  (If you have ever tried any of the "other" screen-
saver management applications out there, you know that they are neither easy ...
nor professional!)  So enjoy your free 30-day trial, and when you know that you
can't live without it, purchase the full version of ProSaver for just
$22.95(US). You'll never have to miss seeing your favorite screensavers again!

  As with all WaveBreak Software products, this screensaver contains NO ADWARE,
NO SPYWARE, or other HIDDEN SOFTWARE, which are common annoyances found in many
of the "free" screensavers and games that are available for download today.
Our software is of the highest quality, and we at WaveBreak Software refuse to
bombard our valued customers with these nuisances.
 
  This software is distributed as SHAREWARE.  The basic shareware premise is
"try before you buy," which is obviously the most natural and comfortable way
to purchase any product.  Few people would buy a car without taking it for a
test drive or purchase a tool without knowing what it does, and software is no
exception to this rule.  The shareware principle allows a software product to
be installed and used, with some limitations, before any money is exchanged.
If the software runs properly and is useful to the consumer, then the fully-
functional version can be purchased and installed, with little or no risk to
the purchaser of owning software they do not need or cannot use.

This software is distributed in two ways.  If you have downloaded this software
from a Bulletin Board Service or similar download site, then the software comes
in a compressed ZIP file.  Use a program such as WinZip to open/extract the
files inside and run the SETUP.EXE program to begin installation.  If you have
received this software from WaveBreak Software or an authorized distributor,
then the software is contained in a self-extracting EXE file.  Running this
file will extract the necessary files to a temporary folder, and the SETUP.EXE
program will then begin installation automatically.  Follow the instructions on
the screen to install the software.

The following files will be copied into the folder chosen during installation:

ProSaver.exe:  Main application file.  This file will be copied to the Windows
               root directory (generally C:\WINDOWS) as 'ProSaver.scr' so
               that it can be accessed by the Windows Control Panel.
prosaver.chm:  ProSaver Screensaver Manager help file.  Provides instructions
               on using the software to ensure your full enjoyment of the
               program.
svrhook.dll:   Contains processes which allow hotkeys to function correctly
               during screensaver playback.
file_id.diz:   Application information used by automated online distribution
               systems in conjunction with this software.
pad_file.xml:  Application information used by automated online distribution
               systems in conjunction with this software.
license.txt:   End-user license agreement.
readme.txt:    Application read-me file (this file).
order.txt:     Printable order form.
uninst.isu:    InstallShield log file (used for program removal).

The following sample audio files will be copied into a folder with the name
'Audio': 'Adventure.mid', 'Alien World.mid', 'Canon in D.mid', 'Caveman
Drums.mid', 'Creepy.mid', 'Epic Battle.mid', 'Fur Elise.mid', 'Lost and
Alone.mid', 'Mysterious.mid', 'Space Battle.mid' and 'Spooky.mid'.

In addition, an empty folder with the name 'PList' will be created for storage
of your own screensaver and audio playlists.

If you have selected the option to log errors, the file 'errorlog.txt' will be
created in the installation folder and updated during screensaver playback.

 • Depending on the speed and/or configuration of you computer, it may take an
   extended period of time (generally no more than 30 seconds) to open folders
   containing numerous files and/or subfolders while using the Music Manager.
   You may also see the Music Manager window redraw itself a few times while
   such folders are loading.  This is a natural result of the program's
   operation, and our programmers have taken extra steps to ensure that the
   application does not report itself as 'Not Responding' during this time
   period.  If you see 'Not Responding' in the ProSaver title bar, then there
   is a problem.  Otherwise, wait patiently and rest assured that the folder's
   contents will appear as soon as they have been loaded.

 • On most systems, the audio hotkeys will not be available for the first few
   seconds of each screensaver's playback.  This is not considered a bug in the
   application, but is simply the result of several operations that must take
   place in the background during the playback process.  You can consider the
   audio hotkeys ready to be used only after music playback has started.
   (Attempting to use the hotkeys before this will, in most cases, close the
   screensaver.)

 • There are two situations in which the audio hotkeys will not work.  Both
   of these are known to occur only under Windows XP:  (1) When the 'Password
   protect' box is checked under the screensaver configuration in Windows
   Control Panel, and (2) When the screensaver starts while the login screen is
   displayed.  Both of these issues are related to Windows security, and are
   not considered bugs.  (As part of its security features, Windows XP blocks
   keyboard input to all third-party applications during the password and login
   screens.  You will notice that any hotkeys for your other applications will
   not function during these times either.)  A workaround for situation (1) is
   to turn off password protection for screensavers under Windows Control Panel.
   There is no workaround for situation (2); the hotkeys will function normally
   only after a successful login.
