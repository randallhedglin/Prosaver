watching.  Whether it's gently flowing waterfalls, morphing geometrics, or
blasting enemy spaceships in the outer reaches of space, it can be hard to pick
just one!  And any user of Windows knows that it can be a real hassle
to change your screensaver on a frequent basis.

Software!  ProSaver is a full-featured screensaver management and enhancement
application.  ProSaver will make your life easier and more fun in many ways:

 • Run all of your favorite screensavers without ever having to bother with the
   tedious Windows Control Panel.

 • Quickly and easily create playlists from your available screensavers and set
   them to play back just the way you like using our concise 'Options' sheet.

 • Newly downloaded screensavers can be added to the current playlist with a
   few clicks of the mouse, and "stale" screensavers deleted just as easily.

 • Organize your screensavers by theme, and give them ratings (from 1 to 5
   stars) so you can find the best ones quickly.

 • Open the ProSaver playlist window or start your screensaver instantly with
   the touch of a button.

  And, as an added feature, have you ever thought that a certain screensaver
would be just perfect ... if only it had a certain song playing in the back-
ground?  With ProSaver Screensaver Manager, you can do exactly that!  Add your
favorite music to almost any screensaver, and turn a *good* screensaver into a *great* one!

  Sometimes you just need to kick back and relax, and screensavers are a great way to do exactly that!  You've earned a break, so download your free copy today!</Char_Desc_2000>
